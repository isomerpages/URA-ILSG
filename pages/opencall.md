### **i Light Singapore 2023 Open Call**

The sustainable light festival will return for its 9th edition to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay.

For this edition, we continue to invite artists to explore various forms of Sustainability and Sustainable Living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making and the community.

The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2023, **A New Wave**, calls for innovative light art installations that encompass associations with the colour blue – the limitless potential of technology to create novel experiences beyond the physical, and the synergy between nature and technology. 

**A New Wave** encourages creative methods and ideas that reflect the energy of blue to inspire connections in the city, refresh people’s senses and immerse visitors in new realms.
