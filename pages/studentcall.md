### **i Light Singapore 2023 Student Call**

An open call for students from local tertiary institutions, the i Light Singapore Student Call enables creative youths to realise their potential through light art installations.

i Light Singapore, Asia’s leading sustainable light festival, will return for its 9th edition in 2023 to illuminate Marina Bay with a constellation of light artworks to spark excitement and interactions. The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2023, A New Wave, calls for innovative light art installations that encompass associations with the colour blue – the limitless potential of technology to create novel experiences beyond the physical, and the synergy between nature and technology. 

A New Wave encourages creative methods and ideas that reflect the energy of blue to inspire connections in the city, refresh people’s senses and immerse visitors in new realms.
