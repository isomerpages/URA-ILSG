### **The Festival**

i Light Singapore is Asiaâ€™s Leading Sustainable Light Festival held in Marina Bay.

Held since 2010, i Light Singapore showcases light art installations created by artists from Singapore and around the world. These light art installations are designed with energy-saving lighting or environmentally-friendly materials to encourage festival goers and the general public to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives. The Festival also features a range of fringe activities for visitors to enjoy, bringing vibrancy to public spaces in our city centre.

Providing an array of events and activities throughout the year, Singapore is a place that offers endless unique experiences for all. Click [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/corporate/get-involved/shape-a-distinctive-city/explore-our-city) to find out more.
