### **The Festival**

i Light Singapore is Asiaâ€™s Leading Sustainable Light Festival held in Marina Bay.

First held in 2010, i Light Singapore showcases light art installations created by Singaporean and international artists. These artworks are designed with energy-saving lightings and/or environmentally-friendly materials to encourage festival goers and the general public to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives. The Festival also features a diverse range of fringe activities for visitors to enjoy, bringing vibrancy to public spaces in our city centre.

i Light Singapore 2022, presented by DBS, will be held from 3 to 26 June 2022, 7.30pm to 11.00pm daily with extended hours to 12.00am on Fridays and Saturdays. Admission is free, while charges apply for certain programmes.

The Festival is also one of the partner events held in support of the Year of Celebrating SG Families. Check out the calendar of events and activities that you can enjoy with your family. Click [here](https://go.gov.sg/CelebratingSGFamilies) to find out more.
